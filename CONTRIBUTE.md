### Development

Here are a couple of useful commands that you should know if you want to work on the library itself (as opposed to just using it as a dependency).

* **`flutter format .`** - Format code
* **`flutter test`** - Run all tests
* **`flutter analyze`** - Run the analyzer on the `lib` and `test` folders
* **`bash coverage.sh`** - Run tests, collect coverage and generate HTML report
